# Brief Instructions for Using Git on Windows #

Download the tools in the "Tools Needed" section.  These are the tools I have used
on Windows.  Feel free to do your own experimentation and find something that suits
your development style better.

## Tools Needed ##
You need to download a git client:

You will need an editor of some kind:

You can merge stuff by hand, which is what I have done on Windows, but there are tools
to help you.  I am a linux user so I just use vim, so this may not be the best tool, 
but it is what the internet recommends:

Some folks like to use the VisualStudio community edition that has its own set of tools that
works with git and does merging.  If that is something that interests you, check it out.

## What Now? ##
Ok, you got all of that stuff downloaded and installed.  What do I do first?  We need to clone 
the project.
